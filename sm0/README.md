# How to run Program

- I used Meson as the build system. To run you can either install Meson or use gcc.
- I provided an executable called countUD case you just want to run that.

How I compiled my program:

I installed meson and ninja:
sudo apt install meson ninja-build

1. meson setup build

2. meson compile -C build

3. ./build/countUD [files]
